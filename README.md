# Automated-Student-Attendance

The Automated Student Attendance System is a Python-based application that utilizes face recognition to automate the process of recording student attendance. It generates an attendance report in a CSV file and updates the attendance records in an SQL database. The attendance records can be viewed through a website built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.

## Features

- Face recognition: The system uses face recognition algorithms to identify and verify students' identities.
- Attendance recording: It automatically records student attendance and generates a detailed attendance report in a CSV file.
- Database integration: The attendance records are updated in an SQL database, allowing easy retrieval and management of attendance data.
- Web interface: The attendance records can be viewed through a user-friendly website built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.
