## Automated Student Attendance System Using Facial Recognition

This system uses facial recognition to automatically take attendance for students. It is designed to be used in a classroom setting, and can be used by teachers or administrators.

The system requires a webcam and a computer with a powerful enough processor to run the facial recognition software. The software can be downloaded for free from the internet.

To use the system, students must first be enrolled. This can be done by taking a picture of each student's face. The picture will be used to create a facial recognition model for each student.

Once all of the students have been enrolled, the system can be used to take attendance. To do this, the teacher or administrator simply needs to start the software and point the webcam at the classroom. The software will automatically detect the faces of all of the students in the room and mark their attendance.

The system can also be used to track student attendance over time. This information can be used to identify students who are frequently absent or tardy.
